# abhi-llm-apps

Welcome to abhi-llm-apps, a curated collection of prototypes demonstrating best practices for working with Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-powered applications, and intelligent agents.

This repository showcases LLM applications leveraging models from OpenAI, Llama 3, and Mistral, along with an implementation of Ollama, enabling you to run models locally on your computer. Please refer to the Ollama hardware requirements to ensure optimal performance.

Whether youâ€™re exploring generative AI, experimenting with cutting-edge LLM capabilities, or building AI-driven solutions, this repository is designed to inspire and guide technical audiences.
