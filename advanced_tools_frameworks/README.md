Advanced Tools and Frameworks

**Mixture of Agents (MoA)**
Leverage the collective power of multiple LLMs to achieve superior performance:
Combines responses from various models to produce refined, accurate outputs.
Ideal for applications like synthetic data generation and complex problem-solving.

**Route LLM**
Optimize cost and performance by dynamically routing queries between strong and weak models:
Utilizes router frameworks for real-time decision-making.
Ensures a balance between resource efficiency and response quality.

**Semantic Cache Implementation**
Boost application speed and reduce inference costs:
Cache frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.
Enable scalable and cost-effective AI applications without sacrificing performance.

**LLM as a Judge**
Robust evaluation framework for your llm applications:
The framework applies the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, utilizing powerful language models as evaluators to analyze and grade generated outputs. This ensures objective and consistent evaluation across metrics.
Answer Relevancy: Measures how relevant the generated answers are to the provided query.
Faithfulness: Ensures that generated answers are grounded in the provided context and do not hallucinate information.
