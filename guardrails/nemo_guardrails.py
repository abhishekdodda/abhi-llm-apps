In the below exercise, we show how NeMo-Guardrails can be used alongside its [out-of-the-box integration with Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails/blob/develop/docs/user_guides/community/presidio.md) to detect and filter personally identifiable information (PII) in inputs and outputs for our chatbot.

We define a flow `financial` to design a conversation where the user asks for financial PII on a subject, with a defined message `answer financial` to simulate a mechanism for the bot to retrieve said financial PII. This is a mock for demonstrative purposes. In a production scenario, this `answer financial` message would be removed and the guardrail would instead be configured to act directly on either the chatbot output or the retrieval output.

"""## Integrating with Llama Guard model for content moderation

**Llama Guard** is a middleware model developed by Meta to enhance the safety and ethical deployment of AI systems. It acts as a filtration system by classifying content as safe or unsafe based on predefined categories, like violence, criminal planning, sexual content, or promotion of suicide & self-harm. Through the use of a taxonomy of harmful content categories, it ensures that AI-generated content adheres to ethical guidelines, preventing harmful or inappropriate material.

In the following demo, we utilize a hosted serverless inference endpoint from [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/) to run the [LlamaGuard model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b). In order to follow along with this exercise, perform the below steps before you continue with the notebook:

1. Register an account with Runpod.
2. On your account dashboard, go to the [Serverless page](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless), and under “Serverless vLLM”, click “Start”.
3. Input your Hugging Face model, which is "meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b" for this exercise. Llama Guard is a private and gated model, so therefore you will also need to supply your HuggingFace token in the same dialog.
4. Click "Next". You have the option of customizing your vLLM settings, which you might do if (for example) you were using a quantized model, but this is not required for our exercise.
5. Choose your GPU.
6. Click "Deploy".
7. Copy the "OpenAI Base URL" value for the deployed endpoint. Return to this notebook and add a new secret RUNPOD_API_BASE to your Colab notebook Secrets tab with that copied value.
8. Back on the Runpod endpoint page, click "Create new API key" next to your "OpenAI Base URL" value if it is shown. Copy the generated API key. Return to this notebook and add a new secret called RUNPOD_API_KEY with that value to your Colab Secrets tab.

### Setting up the rails for Llama Guard

NeMo Guardrails provides out-of-the-box integration with Llama Guard. In your `rails` configuration, you must specify the exact name for the supported Llama Guard flow, either `llama guard check input` under your input flows or `llama guard check output` under your output flows. Then in the `prompts` section of your configuration, you must provide the prompts to be sent to the Llama Guard model when it is called. These prompts are where you can customize the taxonomy of harm categories used by the chatbot to your unique organization's policies.

In the YAML shown below, we use prompts that are mostly identical to the default prompts released by Meta, but to which we have added an additional harm category "Offensive Language and Insults."
